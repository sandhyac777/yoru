<h1>Key lessons taught by Buddha that you should know about on Buddha Jayanti</h1>

Nepal, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, is celebrating Buddha Jayanti, the birth anniversary of Gautam Buddha, with a public holiday across the nation. But it is not only Nepal that celebrates Buddha Jayanti in reverence for Buddha’s teachings as Buddhists across the world are following his path.

The Tripiṭaka is the term used in Buddhism to refer to three collections of scriptures of Buddha’s teachings: Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka, and Abhidhamma Pitaka. Vinaya Pitaka contains rules and stories about the Buddha and his disciples, Sutta Pitaka contains discourses on various topics, and Abhidhamma Pitaka contains detailed analyses of Buddhist teachings. It is considered the most important and authoritative collection of Buddhist scriptures, studied by scholars and monks worldwide. It is a primary source of Buddha’s teachings, guiding practitioners seeking wisdom, compassion and inner peace.

Here is a list of key lessons taught by Buddha that you should know about.

Four noble truths
The four noble truths are a fundamental part of Buddha’s teachings and are intended to be a guide for how to live a fulfilling life. The four truths include:

Truth of suffering
Truth of the origin of suffering
Truth of cessation, and 
Truth of the path
The first truth accepts that pain will always be a part of life. The second truth is that to be free of suffering, we must learn to let go of our attachments and wants. The third fact reassures us that we may end suffering, and the fourth truth offers a path to do so by following the eightfold path. By following these teachings, it is believed that one can achieve enlightenment and ultimately reach nirvana.
